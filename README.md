# DOSE

Optimal Exact Designs of Multiresponse Experiments under Linear and Sparsity Constraints.

## Purpose

The repository contains `R` script to generate designs and Figure 1 from the paper Optimal Exact Designs of Multiresponse Experiments under Linear and Sparsity Constraints (https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04713). 


## Installation

To run the code, `R` with `OptimalDesign` library (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OptimalDesign/index.html) and `gurobi` (https://www.gurobi.com/) is needed. For installation instructions, see the file gurobi_inst.txt in `OptimalDesign` library.
